# Capstone - HTML/CSS - Fruit Bazaar

> In this project, I got the chance to build a responsive website of a Fruit Bazaar. I‚Äôll be using Mohammad Awad layouts from this incredible work he did and post in [B√´hance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/24796463/ZATTIX), with some changes, this page I planned to use it for learning purposes for mastering SASS pre-compiler. Here I'll add a shot of the main content;
